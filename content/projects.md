# [Leveraging Codes](https://leveragingcodes.com) ... coming soon:
* This project is my dream in achieving better performance in finance and investment using programming. In this project I am going to review and make codes in finance. Leverage means ["to use something that you already have in order to achieve something new or better"](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/leveraging) and in finance means ["using borrowed capital as a funding source"](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp). So I am going to borrow codes power in making value in finance industry.
